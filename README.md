-	Description: Created a movie recommender system that utilizes content-based filtering algorithms to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and movie attributes. Extracted relevant features from movie metadata (TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset), such as genres, actors, and directors. Implemented a content-based filtering algorithm to calculate similarities between movies and recommend movies with similar attributes to those previously liked by the user. Deployed the system on Heroku to make it accessible to users via a user-friendly web interface.
